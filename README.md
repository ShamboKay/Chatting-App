# Chatting-App

This will be where I try to make some sort of chatting app like discord for my learning. I will try get some features done each day as I also try to understand how to code.

I feel like I will enjoy this aspect as it is something I could use with my friends and show what I have made with some usability.

Excited to start this project tomorrow, I have written some psudeocode to try and help me during this starting project. 

Have some cool little features in mind that a normal chatting app doesn't have, at least of what I am aware of.
